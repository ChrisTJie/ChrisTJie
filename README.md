👋 Hello!
I'm a Unity Game Programmer, with nearly seven years of experience, and currently specializing in AR, VR, MR fields.

🎓 I graduated from the Department of Multimedia and Game Science at Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology, equipped with solid digital media technology. I am passionate about my work and always up for new challenges.

🎮 During university, I co-developed five games with my classmates:

- `SOMNUS` - A first-person action shooting game
- `Cyber Finger` - A 3D Top-Down mobile game
- `ELF GO GOBLIN` - A 2D side-scrolling parkour game
- `Vengeance Poupée` - A 2D side-scrolling horror puzzle game
- `Deep Xmas` - A 2D side-scrolling action shooter game

🏆 My game development works have received recognition in several competitions:

- `2020 (Vision Get Wild，VGW) Awards`
- `2020 Youth Innovative Design Festival Creative Design Competition`
- `2nd Taiwan Association of Digital Media Design Awards in 2019`

💼 In my career, I have worked with hardware engineers, using Arduino ESP32 to write Socket code, achieving the goal that VR users can interact with the virtual world through hardware simulation gloves. Moreover, I have developed various interactive MR education, learning, collaboration, and communication software using HoloLens, and have cooperated with the Taiwan Space Agency to develop VR training educational software for new employees.

🔭 If you are interested in my work, or want to explore potential collaborations, feel free to reach out through GitHub or directly via email. I look forward to creating more innovative and interesting projects together!
