👋 Hello!
I'm a Unity Game Programmer with nearly three years of experience, currently specializing in AR, VR, and MR development.

🎓 I graduated from the Department of Multimedia and Game Science at Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology, where I built a strong foundation in digital media technology. I am passionate about game development and always eager to take on new challenges.

🎮 During my university years, I collaborated with my classmates to develop five games:

- **`SOMNUS`** - A first-person action shooting game
- **`Cyber Finger`** - A 3D top-down mobile game
- **`ELF GO GOBLIN`** - A 2D side-scrolling parkour game
- **`Vengeance Poupée`** - A 2D side-scrolling horror puzzle game
- **`Deep Xmas`** - A 2D side-scrolling action shooter game

🏆 My game development projects have received recognition in several competitions:

- **2020 Vision Get Wild (VGW) Awards**
- **2020 Youth Innovative Design Festival - Creative Design Competition**
- **2nd Taiwan Association of Digital Media Design Awards (2019)**

💼 In my professional career, I have collaborated with hardware engineers to use Arduino ESP32 and write Socket code, enabling VR users to interact with the virtual world through simulated hardware gloves. Additionally, I have developed various interactive MR applications for education, learning, collaboration, and communication using HoloLens. Notably, I worked with the Taiwan Space Agency to create VR training software for onboarding new employees.

🔭 If you are interested in my work or exploring potential collaborations, feel free to reach out through GitHub or email. I look forward to creating innovative and exciting projects together!
